# Real-Estate-Appraisal-Analysis

Project: "Real Estate Appraisal Analysis: Impact of Marketing Time and Real Estate Characteristics" 

I have used Uniform Appraisal Dataset (UAD) Appraisal-Level Public Use File (PUF) from Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) to answer question on impact of time on market for premium/discounted pricing compared to appraised value of single family homes. I have incorporated a narrative, working as a contractor for Freddie Mac, to create a business scenario for this project.

I have used FHFA Enterprise Uniform Appraisal Dataset (UAD) Appraisal-Level Public Use File (PUF) from year 2015 to 2022 and presented statistical finding through explanatory regression analysis. 

Final Management Report and R Code for statistical analysis added to this repository.
